### Course Overview

This course introduces the fundamentals of drone technology and programming. Students will learn about drone components, flight principles, and basic programming concepts to control drone movements. *Actual drone flight will depend on age appropriateness, local regulations, and available resources. Simulator software may be used as an alternative or complement to physical drones.*

### Expected Curriculum

* **Week 1:** Introduction to Drones:  Exploring different types of drones and their uses.
* **Week 2:** How Drones Fly:  Understanding the principles of flight and drone aerodynamics.
* **Week 3:**  Drone Components:  Learning about the different parts of a drone and their functions.
* **Week 4:**  Introduction to Drone Programming (Simplified):  Using block-based programming or simplified drone control software.
* **Week 5:**  Programming Drone Movements:  Coding the drone to perform basic maneuvers (e.g., takeoff, landing, hovering).
* **Week 6:**  Drone Challenges and Simulations (or carefully supervised flights if appropriate):  Putting our programming skills to the test.
