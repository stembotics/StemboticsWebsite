### Course Overview

This course introduces fundamental biotechnology concepts through engaging, age-appropriate activities and discussions. We'll explore how scientists use living organisms and their processes to develop new products and technologies in areas like medicine, agriculture, and environmental science. Ethical considerations will also be introduced in an age-appropriate manner. *This topic requires careful adaptation for the K-8 age range. Some aspects of genetic engineering and cloning might be too complex or ethically sensitive for younger audiences.*
