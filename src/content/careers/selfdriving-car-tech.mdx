### Course Overview

This course provides a fun, hands-on introduction to the technology behind self-driving cars. Students will explore how these vehicles use sensors, programming, and AI to perceive their environment and make decisions. Activities will be adapted for K-8 appropriateness, focusing on basic concepts and engaging demonstrations.

### Expected Curriculum

* **Week 1:** What are Self-Driving Cars? Exploring the concept of autonomous vehicles and their potential benefits.
* **Week 2:**  Sensors and Perception: Learning about different sensors used in self-driving cars (cameras, lidar, radar). Simple demonstrations with sensors (e.g., light sensors, distance sensors).
* **Week 3:**  Programming for Autonomous Navigation (Simplified):  Introduction to basic programming concepts using visual programming languages or robots.
* **Week 4:**  Mapping and Localization:  Understanding how self-driving cars create maps and determine their location.
* **Week 5:**  Decision Making and AI:  Simple explanations of how AI helps self-driving cars make decisions.
* **Week 6:**  Building a Mini Self-Driving Car (Simplified Project):  Building and programming a small robot to navigate a simple course.
