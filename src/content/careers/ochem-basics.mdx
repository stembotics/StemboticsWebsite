### Course Overview

This course introduces the basic concepts of organic chemistry—the chemistry of carbon! We'll explore how carbon forms the building blocks of life and many everyday materials through engaging experiments and activities. (Content will be significantly simplified for K-8; focus on observation and exploration rather than complex chemical reactions.)

### Expected Curriculum

* **Week 1:**  Carbon: The Amazing Element!  Introduction to molecules and building with LEGOs or similar building blocks to represent molecules.
* **Week 2:**  Exploring Everyday Organic Materials:  Observing and classifying different materials based on their properties (e.g., plastics, natural fibers).
* **Week 3:**  The Chemistry of Food:  Simple experiments exploring the composition of food (e.g., testing for starch, sugars).
* **Week 4:**  Making Slime and Other Polymers:  Hands-on activities introducing the concept of polymers.
* **Week 5:**  Natural vs. Synthetic Materials:  Discussing the origins and properties of different materials.
* **Week 6:**  The Future of Organic Chemistry:  Age-appropriate discussion of applications in medicine, materials science, etc.
