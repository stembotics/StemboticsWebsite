### Course Overview

This course introduces students to the exciting world of 3D animation and rendering. We'll use age-appropriate software to create simple 3D models, animate them, and create rendered images and short animations. *The complexity of software and projects will be adapted for the K-8 age range.*  Block-based visual programming and simpler 3D modeling tools may be used.

### Expected Curriculum

* **Week 1:** Introduction to 3D Modeling:  Exploring basic shapes and creating simple 3D objects.
* **Week 2:**  Building a 3D Character:  Designing and modeling a simple character.
* **Week 3:**  Introduction to Animation:  Learning the principles of animation and applying them to our 3D character.
* **Week 4:**  Animating Your Character: Creating a short animation sequence.
* **Week 5:**  3D Rendering:  Learning how to add lighting, textures, and effects to our 3D scene.
* **Week 6:**  Showcasing Your 3D Animation:  Sharing and celebrating student projects.
