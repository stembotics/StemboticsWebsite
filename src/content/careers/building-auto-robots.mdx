### Course Overview

This hands-on course introduces students to the exciting world of robotics. We'll build and program simple autonomous robots using age-appropriate tools and platforms. The complexity of projects will be adapted for different age groups within K-8.

### Expected Curriculum

* **Week 1:** Introduction to Robotics:  What are robots, and what can they do?
* **Week 2:**  Building Your Robot:  Assembling a robot platform using LEGOs, other building kits, or pre-assembled robots.
* **Week 3:**  Introduction to Programming:  Using block-based programming languages to control the robot's movements.
* **Week 4:**  Sensors and Control:  Adding sensors (e.g., touch sensors, light sensors) and programming the robot to respond to its environment.
* **Week 5:**  Autonomous Navigation:  Programming the robot to move autonomously (e.g., follow a line, avoid obstacles).
* **Week 6:**  Robotics Challenge:  Putting our skills to the test in a fun robotics challenge.
