Students will learn about drone components, flight principles, and basic programming concepts to control drone movements. *Actual drone flight will depend on age appropriateness, local regulations, and available resources. Simulator software may be used as an alternative or complement to physical drones.*\n\n### Expected Curriculum\n\n* **Week 1:** Introduction to Drones:  Exploring different types of drones and their uses.\n* **Week 2:** How Drones Fly:  Understanding the principles of flight and drone aerodynamics.\n* **Week 3:**  Drone Components:  Learning about the different parts of a drone and their functions.\n* **Week 4:**  Introduction to Drone Programming (Simplified):  Using block-based programming or simplified drone control software.\n* **Week 5:**  Programming Drone Movements:  Coding the drone to perform basic maneuvers (e.g., takeoff, landing, hovering).\n* **Week 6:**  Drone Challenges and Simulations (or carefully supervised flights if appropriate):  Putting our programming skills to the test.\n\n### What You Get\n\n- 1-hour session, every week, for 6 weeks\n\n### Pricing\n- $150 for 6 weeks";
