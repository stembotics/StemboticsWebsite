Students will learn about the different stages of planning a space mission, from defining objectives to designing spacecraft and planning trajectories. We'll use hands-on activities, simulations, and creative problem-solving to bring the wonders of space exploration to life.\n\n### Expected Curriculum\n\n* **Week 1:** What is a Space Mission? Exploring different types of missions (e.g., orbiters, landers, flybys).\n* **Week 2:** Destination: [Planet/Moon]! Choosing a target and researching its characteristics.\n* **Week 3:** Designing Your Spacecraft: Building model spacecraft with specific functions in mind.\n* **Week 4:** Planning the Trajectory:  Simple demonstrations of orbital mechanics and plotting a course.\n* **Week 5:** Mission Challenges:  Problem-solving scenarios related to space travel (e.g., communication delays, resource management).\n* **Week 6:**  Mission Presentation: Students present their mission plans.\n\n### What You Get\n\n- 1-hour session, every week, for 6 weeks\n\n### Pricing\n- $150 for 6 weeks";
