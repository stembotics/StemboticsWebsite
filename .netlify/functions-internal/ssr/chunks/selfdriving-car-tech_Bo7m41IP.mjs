Students will explore how these vehicles use sensors, programming, and AI to perceive their environment and make decisions. Activities will be adapted for K-8 appropriateness, focusing on basic concepts and engaging demonstrations.\n\n### Expected Curriculum\n\n* **Week 1:** What are Self-Driving Cars? Exploring the concept of autonomous vehicles and their potential benefits.\n* **Week 2:**  Sensors and Perception: Learning about different sensors used in self-driving cars (cameras, lidar, radar). Simple demonstrations with sensors (e.g., light sensors, distance sensors).\n* **Week 3:**  Programming for Autonomous Navigation (Simplified):  Introduction to basic programming concepts using visual programming languages or robots.\n* **Week 4:**  Mapping and Localization:  Understanding how self-driving cars create maps and determine their location.\n* **Week 5:**  Decision Making and AI:  Simple explanations of how AI helps self-driving cars make decisions.\n* **Week 6:**  Building a Mini Self-Driving Car (Simplified Project):  Building and programming a small robot to navigate a simple course.\n\n### What You Get\n\n- 1-hour session, every week, for 6 weeks\n\n### Pricing\n- $150 for 6 weeks";
