We'll explore how carbon forms the building blocks of life and many everyday materials through engaging experiments and activities. (Content will be significantly simplified for K-8; focus on observation and exploration rather than complex chemical reactions.)\n\n### Expected Curriculum\n\n* **Week 1:**  Carbon: The Amazing Element!  Introduction to molecules and building with LEGOs or similar building blocks to represent molecules.\n* **Week 2:**  Exploring Everyday Organic Materials:  Observing and classifying different materials based on their properties (e.g., plastics, natural fibers).\n* **Week 3:**  The Chemistry of Food:  Simple experiments exploring the composition of food (e.g., testing for starch, sugars).\n* **Week 4:**  Making Slime and Other Polymers:  Hands-on activities introducing the concept of polymers.\n* **Week 5:**  Natural vs. Synthetic Materials:  Discussing the origins and properties of different materials.\n* **Week 6:**  The Future of Organic Chemistry:  Age-appropriate discussion of applications in medicine, materials science, etc.\n\n### What You Get\n\n- 1-hour session, every week, for 6 weeks\n\n### Pricing\n- $150 for 6 weeks";
