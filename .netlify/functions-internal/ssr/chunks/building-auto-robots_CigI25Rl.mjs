We'll build and program simple autonomous robots using age-appropriate tools and platforms. The complexity of projects will be adapted for different age groups within K-8.\n\n### Expected Curriculum\n\n* **Week 1:** Introduction to Robotics:  What are robots, and what can they do?\n* **Week 2:**  Building Your Robot:  Assembling a robot platform using LEGOs, other building kits, or pre-assembled robots.\n* **Week 3:**  Introduction to Programming:  Using block-based programming languages to control the robot's movements.\n* **Week 4:**  Sensors and Control:  Adding sensors (e.g., touch sensors, light sensors) and programming the robot to respond to its environment.\n* **Week 5:**  Autonomous Navigation:  Programming the robot to move autonomously (e.g., follow a line, avoid obstacles).\n* **Week 6:**  Robotics Challenge:  Putting our skills to the test in a fun robotics challenge.\n\n### What You Get\n\n- 1-hour session, every week, for 6 weeks\n\n### Pricing\n- $150 for 6 weeks";
