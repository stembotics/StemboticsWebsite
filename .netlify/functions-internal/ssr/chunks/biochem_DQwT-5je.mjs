We'll explore the building blocks of life, like proteins, carbohydrates, and DNA, using hands-on activities, models, and simple experiments.\n\n### Expected Curriculum\n\n* **Week 1:**  The Chemistry of Life: What are living things made of?\n* **Week 2:**  Proteins: Building blocks of our bodies. Building models of amino acids (simplified).\n* **Week 3:**  Carbohydrates: The energy of life. Experiments with sugars and starches (e.g., testing foods for sugar).\n* **Week 4:**  Fats and Lipids: Why are they important?  Simple demonstrations of the properties of fats and oils. \n* **Week 5:**  DNA: The secret code of life. Building a DNA model (simplified).\n* **Week 6:**  The Chemistry of Food and Digestion:  Exploring how our bodies break down food into nutrients.\n\n### What You Get\n\n- 1-hour session, every week, for 6 weeks\n\n### Pricing\n- $150 for 6 weeks";
